Power BI Project

Objective:
Developed a dashboard to analyze survey data and derive meaningful insights using Power BI.  
Process Overview:  

1. Data Preparation and Transformation:  
      - Used Power Query to clean and transform the dataset:  
     - Removed unnecessary columns such as "Browser to Reference."  
     - Simplified columns Q1, Q5, Q4, and Q11 by splitting values using a delimiter `("(")` to separate "Other" options into a new column.  
     - For Q3 (salary ranges), calculated average values for simplification.  

2. Dashboard Creation  
   - Designed a title using a text box: "Data Professional Survey Breakdown."
   - Used cards to display key metrics:  
     - Total count of survey takers.  
     - Average age of survey participants.  
   - Built visualizations to analyze and present data:  
     - Stacked bar chart to show the average salary by profession.  
     - Bar chart to display the most popular programming languages.  
     - Tree map to visualize the distribution of respondents by country and how salary varies across countries.  
     - Gauge charts to represent:  
       - Percentage of respondents happy with their job.  
       - Percentage satisfied with their salary.  
     - Donut chart to compare the average salary between male and female respondents.
